## The vuln

 1. Double fetch vulnerability in the kernel module

 2. If the user changes the pointer from a user-space address to the flag buffer in the kernel after the check is complete, they can leak the flag


## The exploit

 1. Create one thread to modify the pointer to the flag buffer address in the kernel.

 2. In the main thread, keep calling ioctl until it returns 0.
